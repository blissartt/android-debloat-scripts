# Android-debloat-scripts

Are you tired of buying a brand new Android smartphone, only to find it filled to the brim with pre-installed bloatware?

Me too.


These scripts are made to debloat your smartphone using the Android Debug Bridge(ADB for short) to remove unwanted packages or privacy invasive bloatware. 

### DISCLAIMER: I am not resposible for anything happening to your device, these scripts are given "as is" without any warranty. If you have any problems with the scripts you can post an issue.
=====================

## Preparation
For the script to work USB debugging needs to be enabled on the device.
Here's how to enable it:

1. Go to the settings app and scroll down to "About Phone".
2. Enter the "Software information" page.
3. Tap on the option "Build number" until it asks you to confirm enabling Developer Options.
4. Go into the "Developer Options", find and enable USB Debugging.

## Usage
THESE SCRIPTS SHALL NOT BE EXECUTED AS ROOT.
To use the desired script, run:

chmod a+x NAME-OF-THE-SCRIPT.sh

./NAME-OF-THE-SCRIPT.sh
